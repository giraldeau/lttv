<H2><TT><A name=S2>1. Downloading Spin</A></TT></H2>Spin runs on Unix,
Solaris, and Linux machines, on most flavors of Windows PCs, and on Macs.
Precompiled binary executables for some popular types of machines are available
in the
<A href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html">Spin Binaries</A>.
<p>
All binaries have an extension that matches the Spin version number,
such as <tt>spin427.exe</tt>. To install the binary, rename it to
<tt>spin.exe</tt> and copy it into your bin directory.
<p>
If you have machine type that is not available there, or if you are
installing Spin for the first time, then follow the more detailed instructions
below.
<ul>

System</A></FONT></TT></H2>
<ul>Place the *.tar.gz file from the <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/index.html">Spin Source Distribution</A> in
  clean directory, and cd to that directory. If you have a standard Unix/Linux system,
  unpack the archive, and compile an executable, for instance as follows: <pre>	gunzip *.tar.gz
	tar -xf *.tar
	cd Src*
	make 	# or, on older distributions: make -f make_unix
</pre>
  <p>If you are on a SOLARIS system, edit the makefile and add
  <TT>-DSOLARIS</TT> to the compiler directives in the makefile before you type
  'make'. Similarly, if you use a different C compiler than defined in the
  makefile, edit the makefile first. You need to have at least a C compiler and
  a copy of yacc.
  <p>If all else fails, you can also compile everything with the following line:
<pre>	yacc -v -d spin.y; cc -o spin *.c
</pre>
  <p>Spin should compile without warnings. Install the executable version of
  spin in a directory that is within your default search path (such as your home
  bin directory, or /usr/local/bin etc.)
  <p>
  On Unix/Linux systems Spin assumes that the standard C preprocessor cpp is
  stored in file "/lib/cpp". On some systems this is different: check the
  comments in the makefile for details if you run into this problem.

  <H3><TT>Testing</TT></H3>To test the basic sanity of the Spin executable, cd
  to the Test directory that was created when you unpacked the source archive,
  and follow the instructions in README.tests file that is included there.
  <H3><TT>Adding Xspin (Unix/Linux)</TT></H3>Xspin is an optional, but highly
  recommended, graphical user interface to Spin, written in Tcl/Tk. To obtain
  Tcl/Tk, see <A href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html#S3">Related
  software</A>. The Xspin source can be found the Xspin4.? directory that will
  also have been created when you unpacked the source tarfile.
  <p>The current version of Xspin is compatible with 
<pre>	Tk version 4.2 - Tcl version 7.6
	Tk version 8.4 - Tcl version 8.4
</pre>
  <p>Xspin prints the version numbers of Spin, Xspin, and Tcl/Tk when it starts
  up. You can also check separately which version of Tcl/Tk you have installed
  by executing the following commands in `wish' (a Tcl/Tk command): <pre>	info tclversion
	puts $tk_version
</pre>You can find out which version of Spin you have by typing, at the
  command prompt: <pre>	$ spin -V
</pre>
  <p>Xspin can also make use the graph layout program 'dot' if it is available
  on your system (not required, but very nice if available -- xspin will
  automatically recognize if it is installed.) For information on 'dot,' see <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html#S3">Related software</A>.
  <p>To install Xspin on Unix/Linux:
  <ul>
    <LI>cd to directory Xspin... from the distribution,
    <LI>Rename xspin*.tcl into a more convenient form (like xspin or xspin.tcl)
    and follow the instructions at the top of this xspin.tcl file. Minimally:
    you must change the first few lines of this file to point to the executable
    `wish' command on your system that you want to use. If you use another
    C-compiler than the default (gcc), you should update the global variable CC
    inside xspin as well. Follow the instructions inside the xspin.tcl file to
    do so.
    <LI>copy the file into a directory within your search path, renamed to plain <tt>xspin</tt>
and make it
    executable, for instance:
<pre>	cp xspin510.tcl /usr/local/bin/xspin
	chmod +x /usr/local/bin/xspin
</pre>
    <LI>On Unix/Linux, invoke the program by typing
<pre>	xspin	# or xspin.tcl if you keep the extension...
or
	xspin promela_spec

For example:
	cd Test
	xspin leader
</pre></LI></ul>Check the online Help menus in xspin for more details on
  routine use. </ul>

<H2><TT><A name=S1b><FONT color=red>2b. Installing Spin on a Windows
PC</FONT></A></TT></H2>
<ul>If you just need to update the Spin executable itself, download a new
  version from <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html">http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html</A>
  If you need more files, e.g. a new copy of Xspin, download the latest
  pc_spin*.zip file from <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/index.html">http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/index.html</A>
  Extract the files from pc_spin*.zip, and copy spin*.exe, renamed spin.exe, into the directory
  where all your commands reside and that is within your default search path
  (e.g., c:/cygwin/bin/, or c:\apps\spin\) You can find out what your search
  path is set to by typing 'set' at an MS-DOS prompt -- this prints a list of
  all defined variables in your environment, including the search path that is
  used to find executable commands.
  (Note that you may need to set the search path in the environment variables)
  <p>If you use Spin from the command line (i.e., without Xspin), be warned that
  some command shells, e.g., the MKS Korn-shell, have none-standard rules for
  argument parsing (i.e., you can not reliably quote an argument that contains
  spaces, such as an LTL formula). In most cases this will not be much of a
  problem, except with the conversion of LTL formula with the Spin -f option.
  You can circumvent this by using -F instead of -f, to read the formula from a
  file instead of the command line.
  <p>To run Spin, also with the precompiled version, you need a working
  C-compiler and a C-preprocessor, because Spin generates its model checking
  software as C-source files that require compilation before a verification can
  be performed. This guarantees fast model checking, because each model checker
  can be optimized to the specific model being checked. Check, for instance, if
  you can compile and run a minimal C program succesfully, e.g.:
<pre>
	#include &#60;stdio.h&#62;
	int main(void) { printf("hello\n"); }
</pre>
  <p>To find a public version of a C compiler and some instructions on how to
  install it see <A href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html#S3">Related
  software</A>.
  <H3><TT>Adding Xspin (PC)</TT></H3>To run Xspin on a PC, you need the PC
  version of Tcl/Tk, which you can find under <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html#S3">Related software</A>.
  <p>The xspin*.tcl source is contained in the .zip file of the <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/index.html">distribution</A>. Copy the .tcl
  file as is into a directory where you plan to work, or put a shortcut to this
  file on the Desktop or in the Start Menu. If you keep the extension .tcl, make
  sure it is recognized as a 'wish' file by the system, so that xspin starts
  when you double click the xspin*.tcl script.
  <p>Under cygwin, copy the xspin*.tcl file to /bin/xspin and make it executable
  -- check the first few lines of xspin*.tcl to make sure the location of xspin
  matches what you have on your system (it is currently setup for
  c:/cygwin/bin/xspin). You can now use xspin as a normal Unix-style command,
  and you can pass the name of a filename to it, for instance as: <pre>	xspin leader
</pre>
  <p>An indirect way to force xspin to startup is to first start `wish' from the
  Start Menu, under Programs, then select the larger window that comes up (the
  command window), and cd to the directory where you've stored the xspin.tcl
  file. Then you can then start it up by typing: <pre>	source xspin.tcl  # or whatever else you've named this
</pre>and you should be up and running.
  <p>The PC installation assumes that you have a command called "cpp.exe"
  available (which comes with the gnu-c installation), which is the traditional
  name of the C preprocessor. Alternatively, it can also use the Visual C++
  compiler, which is named cl.exe for preprocessing. To complicate your life
  somewhat, if you have a copy of the Borland C++ compiler installed, you'll
  notice that this cplusplus compiler was also named cpp.exe -- that's not the
  cpp you want. To avoid the name clash, you either have to edit the Spin source
  code to give it the full path name of the 'real' cpp.exe and recompile, or use
  Spin with the command-line option -Pxxxx where xxxx is the path for cpp.exe.
  Nothing much in Spin will work without access to cpp.exe. You can do a
  reasonable number of things without gcc.exe though (like simulations). The
  C-compiler is required for all verifications and for the automata views in
  Xspin. </p></ul>
<p>
<H2><TT><A name=S1c><FONT color=red>2c. Installing Spin on a Mac</FONT></A></TT></H2>
  <ul>
  Compile Spin from its sources, as described under 2a for Unix systems in general,
  while following the suggestions below, which were provided by
  Dominik Brettnacher, email: <tt>domi@saargate.de</tt>.
<p>
The C preprocessor on Mac OS X cannot be found in <tt>/lib</tt>.
Change the path in the makefile for the
proper location (<tt>/usr/bin/cpp</tt>), and in addition
also tell the Mac preprocessor to handle its input as
"assembler-with-cpp."
This can be done by adding a flag to cpp, for instance in
the makefile by adding the directive
<ul>
<pre>
-DCPP="\"/usr/bin/cpp -xassembler-with-cpp\""
</pre>
</ul>
to the definition of <tt>CFLAGS</tt>.
</pre>
<p>
<H3><TT>Adding Xspin (Unix)</TT></H3>
On the Mac, Xspin is known to work correctly with Tcl/Tk Aqua,
which offers a self-contained binary distribution for the Mac.
Use, for instance, "TclTkAquaStandalone", version 8.4.4 from
<ul>
<pre><a href="http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~steffen/tcltk/TclTkAqua/">http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~steffen/tcltk/TclTkAqua/</a>
</pre>
</ul>
<p>
Xspin by default places its temporary files into the root directory.
This is nasty if you have admin privileges and probably leads to error
messages if you don't.
To prevent this, add a "cd" statement to xspin (no arguments, just cd by
itself on a line), as the first command executed.
Place it, for instance, directly after the opening comments in the file.
This makes Xspin use the home directory for these files.
<p>
TclTk Aqua also provides the possibility to start a script when being run.
For instance, to make Xspin start if you launch the TCL interpreter:
move the xspin file into the "Wish Shell.app", as follows:
<ul><pre>
chmod -R u+w Wish\ Shell.app
mkdir Wish\ Shell.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts
mv xspin*.tcl Wish\ Shell.app/Contents/Resources/Scripts/AppMain.tcl
</pre>
</ul>
</ul>

<H2><TT><A name=S3>3. Related Software</A></TT></H2>
<ul>Pointers to public domain versions of some related software packages are
  discussed below:
  <ul>
    <LI>Gcc,</LI>
    <LI>Cpp,</LI>
    <LI>Yacc,</LI>
    <LI>Tcl/Tk wish,</LI>
    <LI>Dot,</LI>
    <LI>JSpin, and</LI>
    <LI>Ltl2Ba. </LI></ul>
  <H3><TT>GCC</TT></H3>On Unix/Linux you probably have gcc, or an equivalent,
  installed. On the PC you need either a copy of Visual Studio Express (for the cl
  command), or an installation of gcc with minimally the executables: gcc.exe,
  and cpp.exe in your search path, together with all the standard C library
  routines and header files. You can get good free version of all these files
  with the <TT>cygwin</TT> toolkit, which is mostly self-installing and
  available from: <A href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</A>
  <BR>See also what's available in <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html">http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html</A>.

  <H3><TT>Tcl/Tk Wish</TT></H3>To run Xspin you'll need Tcl/Tk. Tcl/Tk was
  written by John Ousterhout (john.ousterhout@eng.sun.com) and is public domain.
  It can be obtained (for PCs or Unix) from cygwin, or from: <A
  href="http://www.tcl.tk/">http://www.tcl.tk/</A> or also (a more recent extension):
  <a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/">
  http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActiveTcl/</a><BR>More details can be found
  in netnews-group: comp.lang.tcl

  <H3><TT>Yacc (optional)</TT></H3>To compile Spin itself from its sources on a
  PC, you'll need to have a copy of yacc installed. A public domain version for
  a PC can most easily be obtained from <b>cygwin</b>, or also from: 
<pre>	<A href="ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/byacc.tar.Z">ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/4bsd/byacc.tar.Z</A>
</pre>A copy of this file is also available in: <A
  href="http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html">http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html</A>
  (You don't need yacc on the PC's if you use the pre-compiled version of Spin
  for the pc in the pc*.zip file from the distribution) Look at the file
  make_it.bat for an example on how to perform the compilation.
  <H3><TT>Dot (optional)</TT></H3>Dot is a graph layout tool developed by
  Stephen North and colleagues at AT&amp;T (email: north@research.att.com).
  Xspin can make use of dot to beautify the layout of the state-machines in the
  automata-view option (recommended!).
To obtain Dot, see
<pre>
	<A href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org/</A>
</pre>
The are both PC and Unix versions of dot available. For documentation of
dot see, for instance:
<pre><I>	A technique for drawing directed graphs</I>,
	by Gansner, Koutsofios, North and Vo,
	IEEE-TSE, March, 1993.
</pre>
If you accept the default installation on a PC, you will need to define the
location of dot.exe in the xspin source as follows:
<pre>
	set DOT "C:/Program\\ Files\ATT\Graphviz/bin/dot.exe"
</pre>
(the line that sets the location of DOT appears near the top of the xspin.tcl file).
<H3><TT>JSpin (optional)</TT></H3>
An alternative to the Xspin GUI, written in Java instead of Tcl/Tk.
Written by Moti Ben-Ari (moti.ben-ari@weizmann.ac.il), see
<pre>
	<a href="http://stwww.weizmann.ac.il/g-cs/benari/jspin/">http://stwww.weizmann.ac.il/g-cs/benari/jspin/</a>
</pre>
The jSpin tool currently expects spin to be installed on Windows in c:/spin/spin.exe, and it assumes that you are using the
mingw version of gcc.
  <H3><TT>Ltl2Ba (optional)</TT></H3>A faster method to generate very small
  never claims from LTL formulae, developed by Denis Oddoux and Paul Gastin is
  available online in source form:
