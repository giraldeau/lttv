The 'genevent' program parses event descriptions and generates 
the inline functions to record events in the kernel.

Right now, the program can only parse simple structure, if a 
structure has a nested structure, it will not work.

There are several files in the directory:
 genevent.c, genevent.h, crc32.tab, parser.c and parser.h

In fact, crc32.tab, parser.c and parser.h are the same files as  
those in LTT library.

'core.xml' is an example event description file.

Here is a brief description of how to use genevent.

make
make install


* Add new events to the kernel with genevent

su -
cd /usr/local/share/LinuxTraceToolkitViewer/facilities
cp process.xml yourfacility.xml
  * edit yourfacility.xml to fit your needs.
cd /tmp
/usr/local/bin/genevent /usr/local/share/LinuxTraceToolkitViewer/yourfacility.xml
cp ltt-facility-yourfacility.h ltt-facility-id-yourfacility.h \
         /usr/src/linux-2.6.12-rc4-mm2-lttng-0.2/include/linux/ltt
cp ltt-facility-loader-yourfacility.c ltt-facility-loader-yourfacility.h \
         /usr/src/linux-2.6.12-rc4-mm2-lttng-0.2/ltt
  * edit the kernel file you want to instrument
    - Add #include <linux/ltt/ltt-facility-yourfacility.h> at the beginning
      of the file.
    - Add a call to the tracing functions. See their names and parameters in
      /usr/src/linux-2.6.12-rc4-mm2-lttng-0.2/include/linux/ltt/ltt-facility-yourfacility.h
