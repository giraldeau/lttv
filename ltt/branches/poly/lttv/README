Linux Trace Toolkit Visualizer

* Getting started

Use ./autogen.sh in the top level directory. It will create the Makefile
for you. Then, you can use make and make install to install this user
tool.

Loading it from the command line is then as simple as :

lttv -L modules-path -m module1 -m module2 ...

So, to load the graphical interface with a detailed events list, it
would be (if the installation prefix is /usr, for instance)

lttv -L /usr/lib/lttv/plugins -m mainwin -m guiEvents

* Tree structure
main:    main program
mainLib: libraries acting as core of the interaction between main program
         and modules.
modules: text and graphical viewing and analysis tools.
