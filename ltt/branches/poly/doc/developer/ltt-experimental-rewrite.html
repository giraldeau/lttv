Here the status of the work in progress for LTT experimental<br>
<br>
* Done<br>
remove ltt-headers.h<br>
remove ltt-log.h<br>
Put trace->active later in _ltt_trace_start()<br>
ltt_trace_create() remove sleep in spinlock use GFP_ATOMIC kmalloc<br>
Fix the locking of module hooks.<br>
Fix the traps -> disable nested logging for now.<br>
Use per cpu spinlock on trace list.<br>
Finish the control module, libltt and lttctl : netlink interface<br>
Finish integrating lttctl with lttd.<br>
fix lttctl signal waiting : use a flag.<br>
Add ltt_write_commit_counter call to genevent.<br>
Add information in the buffer header : buffer size, etc etc...<br>
	-> this information is so small that we can repeat it. Makes flight recorder
	easier to decode.<br>
Add trace start structure to buffer start header.<br>
fix genevent : take no lock if num traces active is 0.<br>
<br>
<br>
* TODO<br>
Add type information per facility : it will help having a standard way
to understand information coming from both kernel space and user space, and deal
easily with 64 bits kernel with 64 and 32 bits processes (and with size_t know
at compile time which can differ inside the same process from one library to
another).<br>
fix structures alignment, array and sequences too. -> trace dynamic.<br>
add per facility alignment (inside structures).<br>
add control of alignment.<br>
add user space tracing.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
* TODO (low priority)<br>
Integrate header generation (genevent) in kernel build system.<br>
Multithreaded lttd.<br>
Find a different way to printk from instrumentation : forbidden from schedule
and wakeup (causes a deadlock).<br>
<br>
* Need to be discussed<br>
Drop ltt-module-register and ltt-module-unregister, use exported variables.<br>
RelayFS ioctl interface vs control through LTT netlink interface.<br>
drop ltt_filter_control, use functions pointers instead.<br>
Merge facilities headers into one big header.<br>
Change the name of XML files from XML to something else.<br>
Remove ltt-base.c.<br>
<br>
* Not planned for integration<br>
Remove the callback struct from the trace struct.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
* Next experimental release patch division :<br>
